# FEUP-BD

This project was developed for the "Bases de Dados" curricular unit and consists of the design and implementation of a database schema for a Social Network.

## First Report

The first report focuses on the initial design of the database, including the development of a UML schema to model all relations, constraints, and elements. A careful and rigorous integration of different generative AI models supported all decisions to achieve the best possible result. All decision explanations and the final UML diagram are available in the [first report](first_report.pdf).

## Second Report

The second report covers the refinement of the UML schema, analysis of functional dependencies and normal forms, and the creation and population of the database using SQLite. Each section was developed with the support of generative AI, building on the choices made in the previous report. All results are available in the [final report](final_report.pdf), and the creation and population scripts are also included in the repository.
